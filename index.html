              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Milwaukie Bay Park</h2>
              
              <h3 id="what-happening-with-development"><a href="#what-happening-with-development">What is happening with Milwaukie Bay Park's development?</a></h3>
              <p>Milwaukie Bay Park, the most visited outdoor park within North Clackamas Parks and Recreation District (NCPRD), is currently awaiting Phase 3 of its development, which includes plans for new amenities like playgrounds, bathrooms, additional shade trees, picnic areas, a splash pad, a stage, and improved river access. However, progress has stalled due to disagreements between the City of Milwaukie and NCPRD, overseen by the Board of County Commissioners (BCC).</p>
              
              <h3 id="why-has-project-been-put-on-hold"><a href="#why-has-project-been-put-on-hold">Why has the project been put on hold?</a></h3>
              <p>The BCC has decided to halt progress on the park until a legal matter between the City of Milwaukie and NCPRD is resolved. The City is seeking legal clarification on the process for potentially withdrawing from NCPRD, but no decision to withdraw has been made. The BCC claims that investing in the park now could be "unjust" to other taxpayers if the City eventually leaves the district. Commissioner Paul Savas used the term ‚Äústranded asset‚Äù to refer to what could happen to the park in such a case.</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-does-city-want-to-do-now"><a href="#what-does-city-want-to-do-now">What does the City of Milwaukie want to do now?</a></h3>
              <p>The City has offered, repeatedly, to engage in negotiations with NCPRD and the BCC with 3rd party mediation. This request has been repeatedly denied by the BCC, who have insisted that they will not come to the table unless Milwaukie drops their appeal.</p>
              
              <h3 id="is-it-unjust-to-other-taxpayers"><a href="#is-it-unjust-to-other-taxpayers">Is it true that proceeding with the park is "unjust" to other district taxpayers?</a></h3>
              <p>No, this characterization is misleading. Milwaukie residents as well as Unincorporated Clackamas County residents are all taxpayers who have contributed to NCPRD for decades. The park is intended to serve all residents of Clackamas County and beyond, including those in unincorporated areas. Halting the project denies everyone much-needed improvements to the most visited park in the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-does-stranded-asset-mean"><a href="#what-does-stranded-asset-mean">What does the term "stranded asset" mean in this context?</a></h3>
              <p>The BCC is concerned that if NCPRD invests in building the park and the City of Milwaukie later leaves the district, the park would become a "stranded asset"‚Äîan investment that no longer benefits NCPRD taxpayers. However, this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Milwaukie‚Äôs parks will always remain accessible to the public, regardless of where its visitors reside. Any concerns about ownership and maintenance of assets like picnic benches and bathrooms can be managed through legal agreements, which the City is willing to negotiate in good faith.</p>
              
              <h3 id="can-park-and-legal-issues-be-handled-separately"><a href="#can-park-and-legal-issues-be-handled-separately">Can't the park and the legal issues be handled separately?</a></h3>
              <p>Yes, they can, and this is the most important point. The BCC has unnecessarily tied two unrelated issues together, using this as justification to halt progress on the park indefinitely. The legal matter is about clarifying the process for potential withdrawal from NCPRD. It does not prevent the City and NCPRD from collaborating on the park's development. By proceeding with the park, both parties can continue to serve the community while the legal issue is resolved.</p>
              
              <h3 id="should-ncprd-invest-if-city-might-leave"><a href="#should-ncprd-invest-if-city-might-leave">If the City might leave NCPRD, why should the district invest in the park?</a></h3>
              <p>Because no decision to leave has been made, and investing in the park benefits all district residents. Additionally, moving forward with the project could strengthen the partnership between the City and NCPRD, potentially influencing the City to remain in the district. Even if the City did someday leave NCPRD, the park would remain open to everyone, continuing to be a regional asset to residents of Clackamas County and beyond.</p>
              
              <h3 id="how-park-benefits-unincorporated-residents"><a href="#how-park-benefits-unincorporated-residents">How does Milwaukie Bay Park benefit unincorporated Clackamas County residents?</a></h3>
              <p>Milwaukie Bay Park is designed to be a regional destination. Residents from unincorporated areas frequently visit Milwaukie for work, shopping, and recreation. The park will offer amenities and events that all community members can enjoy, enhancing quality of life throughout the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="will-park-investment-take-away-from-other-neighborhoods"><a href="#will-park-investment-take-away-from-other-neighborhoods">Will investing in Milwaukie Bay Park take resources away from other neighborhoods?</a></h3>
              <p>No. The funds allocated for Milwaukie Bay Park are already in the budget and have been planned for years. Advancing this project doesn't prevent NCPRD from investing in park-deficient neighborhoods. Both objectives can be pursued simultaneously to ensure equitable access to parks across the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-happens-to-existing-investments-if-halted"><a href="#what-happens-to-existing-investments-if-halted">What happens to the investments already made if the project is halted?</a></h3>
              <p>Significant planning and initial investments have already been made. Halting the project now could result in wasted resources and missed opportunities for community enrichment. Proceeding ensures that past investments yield the intended benefits.</p>
              
              <h3 id="how-can-risks-be-managed"><a href="#how-can-risks-be-managed">How can the risks of the City potentially leaving NCPRD be managed?</a></h3>
              <p>Through legal agreements and contracts. These can include provisions that protect NCPRD's investments, such as reimbursement clauses or guarantees that the park remains accessible to all district residents, regardless of future jurisdictional changes.</p>
              
              <h3 id="how-to-support-park-development"><a href="#how-to-support-park-development">What can I do to support the continuation of Milwaukie Bay Park's development?</a></h3>

              <h3>
                9/11/24: Your voices are making a difference!
              </h3>

				<p>
					In the agenda for tonight's District Advisory Committee there is a promising update about grant funding:

					<blockquote>NCPRD staff has recently met with federal, state, and local grant partners to maintain the current grant funding. NCPRD is seeking a formal extension for our federal grant until fall 2026. This is the only grant with a firm deadline. The other grant partners have said they will follow. NCPRD budget resources for phase three improvements are still secure and still in the budget.</blockquote>
					
					The report also states:<br><br>

				<blockquote>
					The Board of Directors have received several emails in support of completing phase three improvement at the park. These go into the Director log for community input.</blockquote>

					But just because the funding is secure until 2026 does not mean our work is done. The park is still "on hold" while the Clackamas County Commissioners refuse to negotiate in good faith with the City of Milwaukie. Meanwhile construction costs continue to skyrocket due to inflation.<p><br>

					Here is the standard response email from the County Commissioners:

					<blockquote>
						Phase three of Milwaukie Bay Park is on
						pause because there‚Äôs been no progress on updating the intergovernmental
						agreement between NCPRD and the City of Milwaukie. It is our understanding
						the City is seeking to clarify an appropriate legal route for their potential future
						withdrawal from the District. Before continuing construction, the district needs
						assurance that should Milwaukie choose to depart, District investments are not
						removed from district ownership at the expense of the rest of the District‚Äôs
						taxpayers.
					</blockquote>

					This doesn't make sense.  If Milwaukie did leave the district, many things could indeed change.  But ownership and accessibility of the park would not.  The park is owned by the City, and would remain owned by the City whether or not the City leaves the district.  The park is open to the public, and would remain open to the public regardless of whether or not the City leaves the district. 
<p><br>
					<b>The City of Milwaukie is trying to negotiate in good faith with the County Commissioners, but they are refusing to come to the table.</b>
					<p>
					From the <a href="https://www.milwaukieoregon.gov/sites/default/files/2024-0903-ws_packet.pdf">Sep 3, 2024 City Council meeting</a>:

					<blockquote>Mayor Batey asked if the District Board would be open to
						conversations with two Commissioners and two City Councilors to try to make progress on
						Milwaukie Bay Park, but Director Savas clarified that they would not resume negotiations until
						the appeal on the validation action is resolved or dropped.</blockquote>

					Keep those emails to the County Commissioners coming! Tell them it's time to sit down with the City and work out a plan!

                  $2.4 million in grant money was secured years ago for
                  improvements that would make the park more accessible to
                  everyone. This money was intended to build bathrooms, plant
                  shade trees, construct a picnic area, playground, and a splash
                  pad at Milwaukie Bay Park.

              <h3>Public transparency and accountability is lacking.</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In 2021, the County Board of Commissioners directed NCPRD put
                  a ‚Äú90-day hold on the project‚Äù as Commissioner Paul Savas was
                  concerned that Milwaukie could one day leave the North
                  Clackamas Parks and Recreation District. Tying this issue to
                  park construction is political theater. Regardless of whether
                  Milwaukie leaves the district, the park would remain equally
                  accessible to everyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For over two years now that ‚Äú90-day hold‚Äù has been in place
                  and no planning or development has occurred. Meanwhile,
                  construction costs have skyrocketed with inflation and NCPRD
                  has focused parks development efforts on other projects, as
                  well as new master planning for the entire district.
                </li>

                  Friends of Milwaukie Bay Park emailed NCPRD in August asking
                  about this 90 day hold, and for the website to be updated with
                  information about the status of the grant money. The email was

              </h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You may hear a talking point from the County Commissioners
                  that construction is delayed because Milwaukie is pursuing
                  legal action against the county. Don't buy it. This is
                  misdirection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The City is seeking clarification from the courts on whether
                  Milwaukie could hypothetically leave the district, but no
                  decision has been made on what the City may do in the future.
                  Since the park is a regional benefit to everyone, this open
                  question should not be an excuse to hold up construction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's time to separate these two issues, so that we can improve
                  a regional park that's of benefit to those all over Clackamas
                  County and beyond.
                </li>

              Here are some ideas to get you started:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We want full transparency on the NCPRD's MBP website. No more
                  indefinite project holds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where's the Funding? We want commitments that you are doing
                  everything you can to save the $2.4 million in grant money.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We want to see a plan for resuming the construction phase and
                  building MBP.
