										<h2>Here are the facts</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>Milwaukie Bay Park is a riverside oasis open to everyone.  But it's unfinished.</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>$2.4 million in grant money was secured years ago to build bathrooms, plant shade trees, construct a picnic area, playground, and a splash pad at Milwaukie Bay Park. [<a href="https://sites.jla.us.com/files/milwaukiebaypark/about/2019-0424-mbp-aerialrendering.pdf?42bd0534e1" target="new">See the final park design here</a>]</li>
										<li>These grants include $370,000 in state grants, $1.5 million in Metro grants, and $520,000 from the Land and Water Conservation Fund [<a href="https://www.milwaukieoregon.gov/sites/default/files/2024-0618-ws_packetexhibits.pdf">Source</a>]. </li>
										<li>The Clackamas County Commissioners directed NCPRD to put the project on hold well over a year ago.</li>
										<li>According to the project timeline, construction should have been completed by now.</li>
									</ol>

									<h3>Public transparency and accountability is lacking.</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>In 2022, the County Board of Commissioners directed NCPRD put a “90-day hold on the project” as Commissioner Paul Savas was concerned that Milwaukie could one day leave the North Clackamas Parks and Recreation District. This concern is political theater.  Regardless of whether Milwaukie leaves the district, the park would remain equally accessible to everyone.
										</li><li>
											For over two years now that “90-day hold” has been in place and no planning or development has occurred. Meanwhile, construction costs have skyrocketed with inflation and NCPRD has focused parks development efforts on other projects, as well as new master planning for the entire district.
										</li><li>
											For proof of this lack of transparency, see past web snapshots of the park page from [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230601191037/https://ncprd.com/milwaukie-bay-park-project">June 01 2023</a>] and [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240706071115/https://ncprd.com/milwaukie-bay-park-project" target="new">July 06 2024</a>] which mention this "90 day hold".</li> 
										<li>Friends of Milwaukie Bay Park emailed NCPRD in August asking about this 90 day hold, and for the website to be updated with information about the status of the grant money.  The email was never answered.</li>
										<li>Someone updated the <a href="https://ncprd.com/milwaukie-bay-park-project">park page</a> in the past few weeks to remove the "90 days" wording, without adding any details about project timing or acknowledging the lapsing grant money.</li>
									</ol>

									<h3>We may lose this grant money due to fiscal mismanagement</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>This grant money was tied to construction deadlines, and this grant money is at risk of being lost.
											[<a href="https://ncprd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MBP-Schedule.pdf" target="new">See the project schedule</a>]
										</li>
										<li>Allowing grant money to lapse may affect Milwaukie's ability to secure grants in the future.</li>
									</ol>

									<h3>We need to untangle this from separate issues to move forward</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>
											There is an open legal question about whether or not Milwaukie will leave the North Clackamas Parks and Recreation District.  
											</li><li>
											This is a complex matter that's not likely to be resolved soon.  
										</li><li>
											It's time to separate these two issues, so that we can improve a regional park that's of benefit to those all over Clackamas County and beyond.
										</li>
										<li>If you hear the excuse that the park is on hold because of this legal question: don't buy it.  This is political misdirection.</li>
										<li>For a thorough background and timeline on the conflict between the City of Milwaukie and the Clackamas County Commissioners, see <a href="https://www.milwaukieoregon.gov/sites/default/files/2024-0618-ws_packetexhibits.pdf">This document (search for “Parks Goal Update”)</a> from the July 18, 2024 Milwaukie City Council meeting</li>

									<h3>Email the Clackamas County Commissioners</h3>
									<p>The county commissioners are elected to be accountable to the people.  Their email address is: BCC@clackamas.us. </p>
									Here are some ideas to get you started:
									<ol>
										<li>We want full transparency on the NCPRD's MBP website.  No more indefinite project holds.</li>
										<li>Where's the Funding? We want commitments that you are doing everything you can to save the $2.4 million in grant money.</li>
										<li>We want to see a plan for resuming the construction phase and building MBP.</li>
