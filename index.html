              <h2>In a hurry?</h2>
              <p>Here's the quick version.  Milwaukie Bay Park is beautiful, but it's unfinished.  By now we should have had a playground, bathrooms, splash pad, more trees, picnic areas, and a stage.  But all we've got is grass, and very little shade.  The Clackamas County Commissioners have been holding up construction for years, due to playing political games with the park.  There's already money in the NCPRD budget for these items, and over $2.4 million in grant money is at risk of lapsing due to inaction.  
                
                <p>The park is a regional benefit to everyone in Clackamas County, unincorporated and city alike.  When politicians play politics with our parks, everyone loses.  Enough is enough.  Our ask is simple: Our elected officials need to come to the table and work out a compromise to build the park.  The City of Milwaukie is willing.  The Clackamas County Commissioners refuse to come to the table.  Read on to educate yourself on how to see through the charade and tell your elected officials to <b>W</b>ork <b>T</b>ogether for the <b>F</b>uture!</p>

              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Milwaukie Bay Park</h2>
              
              <h3 id="what-happening-with-development"><a href="#what-happening-with-development">What is happening with Milwaukie Bay Park's development?</a></h3>
              <p>Milwaukie Bay Park, the most visited outdoor park within North Clackamas Parks and Recreation District (NCPRD), is currently awaiting Phase 3 of its development, which includes plans for new amenities like playgrounds, bathrooms, additional shade trees, picnic areas, a splash pad, a stage, and improved river access. However, progress has stalled due to disagreements between the City of Milwaukie and NCPRD, overseen by the Board of County Commissioners (BCC).</p>
              
              <h3 id="why-has-project-been-put-on-hold"><a href="#why-has-project-been-put-on-hold">Why has the project been put on hold?</a></h3>
              <p>The BCC has decided to halt progress on the park until a legal matter between the City of Milwaukie and NCPRD is resolved. The City is seeking legal clarification on the process for potentially withdrawing from NCPRD, but no decision to withdraw has been made. The BCC claims that investing in the park now could be "unjust" to other taxpayers if the City eventually leaves the district. Commissioner Paul Savas used the term ‚Äústranded asset‚Äù to refer to what could happen to the park in such a case.</p>

              <h3 id="is-the-city-leaving-the-district"><a href="#is-the-city-leaving-the-district">Is Milwaukie Leaving NCPRD?</a></h3>
              <p>The question of whether Milwaukie can or will ever leave NCPRD is an important one, but it's complicated and it's not likely to be decided soon.  The question of whether or not it can leave is tied up in a legal appeal that may take another 6-12 months by NCPRD estimates.  The question of whether it would leave even if it could has not been voted on.</p>
              
              
              <h3 id="what-does-city-want-to-do-now"><a href="#what-does-city-want-to-do-now">What does the City of Milwaukie want to do now?</a></h3>
              <p>The City has offered, repeatedly, to engage in negotiations with NCPRD and the BCC with 3rd party mediation. This request has been repeatedly denied by the BCC, who have insisted that they will not come to the table unless Milwaukie drops their appeal.</p>
              
              <h3 id="is-it-unjust-to-other-taxpayers"><a href="#is-it-unjust-to-other-taxpayers">Is it true that proceeding with the park is "unjust" to other district taxpayers?</a></h3>
              <p>No, this characterization is misleading. Milwaukie residents as well as Unincorporated Clackamas County residents are all taxpayers who have contributed to NCPRD for decades. The park is intended to serve all residents of Clackamas County and beyond, including those in unincorporated areas. Halting the project denies everyone much-needed improvements to the most visited park in the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-does-stranded-asset-mean"><a href="#what-does-stranded-asset-mean">What does the term "stranded asset" mean in this context?</a></h3>
              <p>The BCC is concerned that if NCPRD invests in building the park and the City of Milwaukie later leaves the district, the park would become a "stranded asset"‚Äîan investment that no longer benefits NCPRD taxpayers. However, this doesn‚Äôt make sense. Milwaukie‚Äôs parks will always remain accessible to the public, regardless of where its visitors reside. Any concerns about ownership and maintenance of assets like picnic benches and bathrooms can be managed through legal agreements, which the City is willing to negotiate in good faith.</p>
              
              <h3 id="can-park-and-legal-issues-be-handled-separately"><a href="#can-park-and-legal-issues-be-handled-separately">Can't the park and the legal issues be handled separately?</a></h3>
              <p>Yes, they can, and this is the most important point. The BCC has unnecessarily tied two unrelated issues together, using this as justification to halt progress on the park indefinitely. The legal matter is about clarifying the process for potential withdrawal from NCPRD. It does not prevent the City and NCPRD from collaborating on the park's development. By proceeding with the park, both parties can continue to serve the community while the legal issue is resolved.</p>
              
              <h3 id="should-ncprd-invest-if-city-might-leave"><a href="#should-ncprd-invest-if-city-might-leave">If the City might leave NCPRD, why should the district invest in the park?</a></h3>
              There are many reasons!
              <ol>
                <li>Because no decision to leave has been made</li>
                <li>Investing in the park benefits all district residents</li>
                <li>$2.4 million in grant money is set aside specifically for these improvements and is at risk of being lost</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Additionally, moving forward with the project could strengthen the partnership between the City and NCPRD, potentially influencing the City to remain in the district. Even if the City did someday leave NCPRD, the park would remain open to everyone, continuing to be a regional asset to residents of Clackamas County and beyond.</p>
              
              <h3 id="how-park-benefits-unincorporated-residents"><a href="#how-park-benefits-unincorporated-residents">How does Milwaukie Bay Park benefit unincorporated Clackamas County residents?</a></h3>
              <p>Milwaukie Bay Park is designed to be a regional destination. Residents from unincorporated areas frequently visit Milwaukie for work, shopping, and recreation. The park will offer amenities and events that all community members can enjoy, enhancing quality of life throughout the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="will-park-investment-take-away-from-other-neighborhoods"><a href="#will-park-investment-take-away-from-other-neighborhoods">Will investing in Milwaukie Bay Park take resources away from other neighborhoods?</a></h3>
              <p>No. The funds allocated for Milwaukie Bay Park are already in the budget and have been planned for years. Advancing this project doesn't prevent NCPRD from investing in park-deficient neighborhoods. Both objectives can be pursued simultaneously to ensure equitable access to parks across the district.</p>
              
              <h3 id="what-happens-to-existing-investments-if-halted"><a href="#what-happens-to-existing-investments-if-halted">What happens to the investments already made if the project is halted?</a></h3>
              <p>Significant planning and initial investments have already been made. Halting the project now could result in wasted resources and missed opportunities for community enrichment. Proceeding ensures that past investments yield the intended benefits.</p>
              
              <h3 id="how-can-risks-be-managed"><a href="#how-can-risks-be-managed">How can the risks of the City potentially leaving NCPRD be managed?</a></h3>
              <p>Through legal agreements and contracts. These can include provisions that protect NCPRD's investments, such as reimbursement clauses or guarantees that the park remains accessible to all district residents, regardless of future jurisdictional changes.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  $2.4 million in grant money was secured years ago for
                  improvements that would make the park more accessible to
                  everyone. This money was intended to build bathrooms, plant
                  shade trees, construct a picnic area, playground, and a splash
                  pad at Milwaukie Bay Park.

                We need to untangle this from separate issues to move forward

              <ol>
                <li>
                  You may hear a talking point from the County Commissioners
                  that construction is delayed because Milwaukie is pursuing
                  legal action against the county. Don't buy it. This is
                  misdirection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The City is seeking clarification from the courts on whether
                  Milwaukie could hypothetically leave the district, but no
                  decision has been made on what the City may do in the future.
                  Since the park is a regional benefit to everyone, this open
                  question should not be an excuse to hold up construction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's time to separate these two issues, so that we can improve
                  a regional park that's of benefit to those all over Clackamas
                  County and beyond.

              <blockquote>
                Dear Clackamas County Commissioners,
<br><br>
I am writing as a concerned citizen to express my strong support for the immediate resumption of construction on Phase 3 of Milwaukie Bay Park. This park is the most visited park in the district, and its completion is eagerly anticipated by residents who value the recreational and environmental benefits it provides.
<br><br>
I understand that there are ongoing discussions regarding the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between the North Clackamas Parks and Recreation District (NCPRD) and the City of Milwaukie. However, I believe that making the completion of Milwaukie Bay Park contingent upon the resolution of separate legal matters is not in the best interest of the community.
<br><br>
The issues surrounding the IGA and the City's potential future withdrawal from NCPRD are legal matters that should be addressed independently. Delaying the park's completion over these issues risks losing grant funding and negates the substantial investments already made by NCPRD, Clackamas County, and Water Environment Services.
<br><br>
NCPRD has invested over $1.1 million since 2017 in Milwaukie Bay Park. Pausing construction jeopardizes this investment and undermines the trust of taxpayers who expect to see tangible results from their contributions. Delays in construction could result in the lapse of crucial grant money allocated for this project. Acting promptly ensures that the community benefits from these funds and that the park reaches its full potential without additional financial burdens.
<br><br>
Completing Phase 3 will provide significant recreational opportunities and improve the quality of life for residents. It aligns with NCPRD's mission to serve the community's needs effectively, even while managing resources carefully.
<br><br>
Even if the City of Milwaukie were to withdraw from NCPRD, the park would continue to serve as a valuable regional amenity accessible to all. The benefits of Milwaukie Bay Park extend beyond city boundaries, enhancing recreational opportunities for the entire district and surrounding areas. Therefore, concerns about it becoming a "stranded asset" are unfounded, as the park will remain a community treasure that supports regional well-being.
<br><br>
I respectfully urge the Board to decouple the Milwaukie Bay Park project from the ongoing IGA negotiations and proceed with construction as planned. Doing so will demonstrate a commitment to the community and ensure that previous investments yield the intended benefits.
<br><br>
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am hopeful for a positive resolution that prioritizes the well-being and interests of our community.
<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br><br>
[Your Name]<br>
