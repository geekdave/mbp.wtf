                9/11/24: Your voices are making a difference!
              </h3>

				<p>
					In the agenda for tonight's District Advisory Committee there is a promising update about grant funding:

					<blockquote>NCPRD staff has recently met with federal, state, and local grant partners to maintain the current grant funding. NCPRD is seeking a formal extension for our federal grant until fall 2026. This is the only grant with a firm deadline. The other grant partners have said they will follow. NCPRD budget resources for phase three improvements are still secure and still in the budget.</blockquote>
					
					The report also states:<br><br>

				<blockquote>
					The Board of Directors have received several emails in support of completing phase three improvement at the park. These go into the Director log for community input.</blockquote>

					But just because the funding is secure until 2026 does not mean our work is done. The park is still "on hold" while the Clackamas County Commissioners refuse to negotiate in good faith with the City of Milwaukie. Meanwhile construction costs continue to skyrocket due to inflation.<p><br>

					Here is the standard response email from the County Commissioners:

					<blockquote>
						Phase three of Milwaukie Bay Park is on
						pause because there’s been no progress on updating the intergovernmental
						agreement between NCPRD and the City of Milwaukie. It is our understanding
						the City is seeking to clarify an appropriate legal route for their potential future
						withdrawal from the District. Before continuing construction, the district needs
						assurance that should Milwaukie choose to depart, District investments are not
						removed from district ownership at the expense of the rest of the District’s
						taxpayers.
					</blockquote>

					This doesn't make sense.  If Milwaukie did leave the district, many things could indeed change.  But ownership and accessibility of the park would not.  The park is owned by the City, and would remain owned by the City whether or not the City leaves the district.  The park is open to the public, and would remain open to the public regardless of whether or not the City leaves the district. 
<p><br>
					<b>The City of Milwaukie is trying to negotiate in good faith with the County Commissioners, but they are refusing to come to the table.</b>
					<p>
					From the <a href="https://www.milwaukieoregon.gov/sites/default/files/2024-0903-ws_packet.pdf">Sep 3, 2024 City Council meeting</a>:

					<blockquote>Mayor Batey asked if the District Board would be open to
						conversations with two Commissioners and two City Councilors to try to make progress on
						Milwaukie Bay Park, but Director Savas clarified that they would not resume negotiations until
						the appeal on the validation action is resolved or dropped.</blockquote>

					Keep those emails to the County Commissioners coming! Tell them it's time to sit down with the City and work out a plan!

                  $2.4 million in grant money was secured years ago for
                  improvements that would make the park more accessible to
                  everyone. This money was intended to build bathrooms, plant
                  shade trees, construct a picnic area, playground, and a splash
                  pad at Milwaukie Bay Park.

                  The Clackamas County Commissioners directed NCPRD to put the

              <!-- Transparency -->
              <h3>Public transparency and accountability is lacking.</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In 2021, the County Board of Commissioners directed NCPRD put
                  a “90-day hold on the project” as Commissioner Paul Savas was
                  concerned that Milwaukie could one day leave the North
                  Clackamas Parks and Recreation District. Tying this issue to
                  park construction is political theater. Regardless of whether
                  Milwaukie leaves the district, the park would remain equally
                  accessible to everyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For over two years now that “90-day hold” has been in place
                  and no planning or development has occurred. Meanwhile,
                  construction costs have skyrocketed with inflation and NCPRD
                  has focused parks development efforts on other projects, as
                  well as new master planning for the entire district.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  Friends of Milwaukie Bay Park emailed NCPRD in August asking
                  about this 90 day hold, and for the website to be updated with
                  information about the status of the grant money. The email was
                  never answered.

                  >
                  in the past few weeks to remove the "90 days" wording, without
                  adding any details about project timing or acknowledging the
                  lapsing grant money.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  This grant money was tied to construction deadlines, and this
                  grant money is at risk of being lost. [<a

                  Allowing grant money to lapse may affect Milwaukie's ability

              <h3>
                We need to untangle this from separate issues to move forward
              </h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You may hear a talking point from the County Commissioners
                  that construction is delayed because Milwaukie is pursuing
                  legal action against the county. Don't buy it. This is
                  misdirection.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The City is seeking clarification from the courts on whether
                  Milwaukie could hypothetically leave the district, but no
                  decision has been made on what the City may do in the future.
                  Since the park is a regional benefit to everyone, this open
                  question should not be an excuse to hold up construction.
                </li>
                <li>
                  It's time to separate these two issues, so that we can improve
                  a regional park that's of benefit to those all over Clackamas
                  County and beyond.

              Here are some ideas to get you started:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We want full transparency on the NCPRD's MBP website. No more
                  indefinite project holds.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Where's the Funding? We want commitments that you are doing
                  everything you can to save the $2.4 million in grant money.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We want to see a plan for resuming the construction phase and
                  building MBP.
                </li>
